- Explanation is well written and helpful (up to 2 points)

## Acceptance criteria
- Hand in code (.py file), resulting image or video (some appropriate file format) and short explanation (.md file) as one zip file via FELIX.
- Illusion effect visible in either the image or video
- From the source code, it is clearly visible that the pixel values are not altered.
