# Assignment #2 - Object counting

## Task
Implement a similar counting application as done in the [GDV Tutorial 07](../GDV_tutorial_07.py) but with the goal of counting the number of chewing gum balls. The script needs to be written in Python and use OpenCV. It should provide a text output stating the number of chewing gum balls for each color (red, green, blue, yellow, white and pink). You can find all example images (prefix is chewing_gum_balls) in the "images" folder. Note that there will be further test images in order to evaluate the performance of your implementation.
Write a short readme how to run the code and a brief explanation (max. 200 words, German or English).

## Rating
- Get correct number for red, green and blue balls in all given example images (2 points)
- Get correct number for red, green or blue balls in all unknown test images (2 points)
- Get correct number for red, green and blue balls in all unknown test images (1 point)
- Get correct number of yellow, white and pink balls in all given example images (2 points)
- Get correct number of yellow, white and pink balls in at least one unknown test images (1 point)
- Get correct number of yellow, white and pink balls in all unknown test images (1 point)
- Code is well readable, structured and documented (up to 2 points)
- Readme is well written and contains all steps to install and run the code (1 point)

## Acceptance criteria
- Hand in code (.py file) and readme.md file as one zip file via FELIX.
- Script runs without changes on one image. Some numbers are printed out.
- In the source code, it is clearly visible that the balls are counted from the image data.

## Pass criteria
- The assignment is passed, if 5 or more points are reached.
